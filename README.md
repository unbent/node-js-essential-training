Greetings!

This is my repo for practicing Node.js while completing the Node.js Essential Training course via LinkedIn.
I will be keeping any pertinent notes within the README, so you can see my thought process.

Useful Links:
- Node.js Global Objects API Documentation: https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html

Notes:
- We want to think about the global object as containing all of the objects, values, and methods that we can use in a Node.js file without having to import anything.
