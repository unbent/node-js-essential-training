Greetings!

This is my repo for practicing Node.js while completing the Node.js Essential Training course via LinkedIn.
I will be keeping any pertinent notes within the README, so you can see my thought process.

Useful Links:
- Node.js Global Objects API Documentation: https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html

Notes:
- We want to think about the global object as containing all of the objects, values, and methods that we can use in a Node.js file without having to import anything.
- Node.js, at least in the way it is being taught so far, is very useful for creating console applications. I really enjoyed making the timers and seeing the percentage marker incrementing. Let's try making a small console application for practice after I'm done with this course.
